## What's Publify?

Publify is a simple but full featured web publishing software. It's built around a blogging engine and a small message system connected to Twitter.

Publify follows the principles of the IndieWeb, which are self hosting your Web site, and Publish On your Own Site, Syndicate Everywhere.

Publify has been around since 2004 and is the oldest Ruby on Rails open source project alive.

- A widgets system and a plugin API

- Multilingual : Publify is (more or less) translated in English, French, German, Danish, Norwegian, Japanese, Hebrew, Simplified Chinese, Mexican Spanish, Italian, Lithuanian, Dutch, Polish, Romanian…

```bash
$ bundle install

$ rake db:seed
$ ./script/rails server
```

You can now launch you browser and access to 127.0.0.1:3000.



## Install Publify on Heroku

In order to install Publify on Heroku, you’ll need to do some minor tweaks.

### Storage

You need to setup Amazon S3 storage to be able to upload files on your
blog. Set Heroku config vars.

```yaml
heroku config:set provider=AWS 
aws_access_key_id=YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID 
aws_secret_access_key=YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY 
aws_bucket=YOUR_AWS_BUCKET_NAME
```

To generate the Gemfile.lock, run:
```bash
HEROKU=true bundle install
```

Remove Gemfile.lock from .gitignore and commit it.

Add the user env Heroku plugin:

```bash
heroku labs:enable user-env-compile -a your_app_name
```

Add the HEROKU config variable to your Heroku instance:

```bash
heroku set:config HEROKU=true
```

Push the repository to Heroku.

When deploying for the first time, Heroku will automatically add a Database plugin to your instance and links it to the application.
After the first deployment, don't forget to run the database migration and seed.

```bash
heroku run rake db:migrate db:seed
```
